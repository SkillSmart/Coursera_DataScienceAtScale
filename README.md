#####Disclaimer concerning the Coursera Honour Code

This is a personal Repository of my ongoing coursework and is not intended to be share
or otherwise discuss my solutions publicly. Following the Courser Honor Code it must not be
used to directly or indirectly submit these as Answers in any Assignment on Coursera. 
As i do want to keep track of my own work on graded assignments as well, i decided to include 
it in this repo. All my coursefiles are indicated as my own work. Changing this information is 
considered to be a deliberate action that i can not be held responsible for.
